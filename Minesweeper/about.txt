OS: Windows

1. first click is 100% safe; and time  starts
2. single-left-click on tile to uncover
3. single-right-click on tile to flag as mine or unflag

4. if a tile has a number same as the flags(assuing that flags depict mines) then double-left-click will uncover all the tiles around it and this will apply recursively for others as well

5. the left-number display represents the number of mines left
6. the right-number display is time(seconds); on exceeding 999 it goes back to 000 but the actual time dont change

7. the middle face button is quick-playbutton; it takes settings from the last mathc settings

8. in menus; only file menu works
9. in file menu>>new, you can decide your own parameters; the limit of max row and column is set in game_functools.py>>rawboard class>> maxlen; however bugs mayarise at some extreme cases

10. the timer is not accurate
11. no sounds in game
